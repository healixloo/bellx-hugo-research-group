abstract: The influence of aging on intestinal stem cells and their niche can explain underlying causes for perturbation in their function observed during aging. Molecular mechanisms for such a decrease in the functionality of intestinal stem cells during aging remain largely undetermined. Using transcriptome-wide approaches, our study demonstrates that aging intestinal stem cells strongly upregulate antigen presenting pathway genes and over-express secretory lineage marker genes resulting in lineage skewed differentiation into the secretory lineage and strong upregulation of MHC class II antigens in the aged intestinal epithelium. Mechanistically, we identified an increase in proinflammatory cells in the lamina propria as the main source of elevated interferon gamma (IFNγ) in the aged intestine, that leads to the induction of Stat1 activity in intestinal stem cells thus priming the aberrant differentiation and elevated antigen presentation in epithelial cells. Of note, systemic inhibition of IFNγ-signaling completely reverses these aging phenotypes and reinstalls regenerative capacity of the aged intestinal epithelium.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Our data represents an unprecedented overview of the transcriptional and cellular composition landscape of intestinal tissue during aging. Importantly, we identified IFNγ as the key player in the intestinal alterations that affect tissue functions and regeneration in aging. We demonstrated that blocking IFNγ in vivo fully rescues aging-associated intestinal phenotypes and loss of regeneration, elevating IFNγ as a very promising therapeutic target for the treatment of complications of human aging-associated intestinal diseases, including intestinal cancer.
