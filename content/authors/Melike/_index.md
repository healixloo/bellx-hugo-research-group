Melike's research centres around the systems biology of ageing, particularly focusing on microbiome-host interactions. We aim to develop and apply computational approaches to:
understand the interactions between microbiome and host during ageing;
establish microbiome as a robust biomarker of ageing;
discover therapeutic candidates to alleviate ageing and age-related diseases;
and eventually, bring microbiome and ageing research to the age of artificial intelligence by developing data integration strategies, databases, and models specializing in age series and longitudinal data.
